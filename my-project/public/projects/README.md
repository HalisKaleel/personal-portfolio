# Project Images

Please add images for your projects in this directory. Each project should have a corresponding image file.

## Image Specifications:
- Format: JPG or WebP
- Resolution: At least 1200x800px
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 4:3
- File Naming: Use the same name as specified in the project data (e.g., project1.jpg, project2.jpg, etc.)

## Current Project Images Needed:
1. project1.jpg - Predictive Analytics Dashboard
2. project2.jpg - Deep Learning Image Classifier
3. project3.jpg - Portfolio Website

## Image Guidelines:
- Use high-quality screenshots or mockups
- Ensure good contrast and visibility
- Optimize images for web (compress without losing quality)
- Consider adding a subtle overlay or frame to maintain consistency

The images will be displayed in the project cards and modal views.
